# WeatherPy

The goal of this project to demonstrate using a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. The data was pulled from [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api). Python libraries used include pandas, numpy, citipy, and matplotlib. Jupyter notebook was also used in order to interactively run the script and view the visualizations. To run the script, just download the repo files and open the notebook. Before running the .pyinb script, be sure to enter an API key in the config.py file.
